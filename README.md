# Photo Scan Metadata

## About

When scanning film negatives, the metadata of the exposures does not match.
This tool fixes that by replacing the EXIF metadata of the scans with its
correct values. It requires a CSV file with the information of each shot
to work.

## How I use it

Whenever I go out to shoot film, I take a picture with my phone of my camera
settingsâ€”that is, shutter speed and aperture. Then, at home, I write the
information in a spreadsheet. I note the date and time, ISO, shutter speed,
and aperture.

This information I use to correct the scans' EXIF metadata. When scanning, each
photo's EXIF metadata is from the digital camera, not the film. This script
replaces the key parts. The exposure information, focal length, and the camera
and lens names.

## How to use

_Note: This is a tool under development_

For now, this tool requires to be built locally. Check the development section
for more information on how to do it. Once it's built then continue on how to
use.

```shell

cargo run -- -s "<PATH_FOR_IMAGES>" -m "<PATH FOR CSV>.csv" -c <CAMERA_MODEL --maker <MAKER> -f <FILM_NAME>

# Example
cargo run -- -s "E:\Photos\Film Scans\2024\06-June" -m "E:\Photos\Film Scans\2024\06-June\metadata.csv" -c Hexar_RF --maker KONICA -f "Kodak Gold 200"
```

An important note: The number of rows of the CSV must match the number of photos
in the given file. Additionally, the images must be in a way that is sortable
by name, like: "1.jpg, 2.jpg ..." or "DSCF2470.RAF, DSCF2471.RAF ..." this way,
the CSV rows will match the images chronologically.

The CSV must be as follows

| no | lens_name              | focal_length | date                      | iso | aperture | shutter_speed | exposure_compensation |
|----|------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|-----|----------|---------------|-----------------------|
| 1  | 7Artisans 35mm f/2 MII | 35           | 2024:06:15 15:39:00+02:00 | 200 | 2.8      | 1/60          | 0.67                  |

An example file can be found under the `fixtures/` path.

### Values in metadata.csv

- **no:** This is not required, I like to use it for an easy management in my shots.
- **lens_name:** String, arbitrary name of your lens.
- **focal_length:** Integer, the focal length of the lens.
- **date:** String, note the format, the yyy-mm-dd might be valid, but I'm not sure, please refer to exiftool documentation.
- **iso:** Integer, ISO of the film (change this if you under or over exposed the film)
- **aperture:** Float, aperture when the shot was made.
- **shutter_speed:** String, use the regular format of 1/60 or 2 (for 2 seconds).
- **exposure_compensation:** String/Float, this is an optional value, it can be left as blank or using any of the following formats:
  - Positive float numbers: 0.33, 0.67, 1.33, etc.
  - Negative float numbers: -0.33, -0.67, -1.33, etc.
  - Positive Fractions: 1/3, 2/3, 1 1/3, etc.
  - Negative fraction numbers -1/3, -2/3, -1 1/3, etc.

## Development

### Requirements

- Rust >= 1.79
- Git >= 2.27

### Installation

This project requires [`exiftool`](https://exiftool.org/), please run the
following script to download it locally.

**Unix Systems**

```bash
./scripts/unix/install.sh
```

**For Windows**

```bat
.\scripts\windows\install.bat
```

### How To Run

Once [`exiftool`](https://exiftool.org/) is installed with the previous script,
run the CLI with cargo.

```shell

cargo run -- -s "<PATH_FOR_IMAGES>" -m "<PATH FOR CSV>.csv" -c <CAMERA_MODEL --maker <MAKER> -f <FILM_NAME>

# Example
cargo run -- -s "E:\Photos\Film Scans\2024\06-June" -m "E:\Photos\Film Scans\2024\06-June\metadata.csv" -c "Hexar RF" --maker KONICA -f "Kodak Gold 200"
